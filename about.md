Hi guys,

Welcome to my very first blog of mine! In this site, you will find out what I am interested in like data analysis, statistics, R, Python, NCAR Command Language (NCL), and meteorology. 

I studied meteorlogical engineering and now I am M.Sc student in Earth System Science at Eurasia Institute of Earth Sciences - Ä°stanbul Technical University.

Also, I love playing video games and going to gym! :muscle:

Hope you love it!


Merih.
